We'll start with a simple example using the built-in Python SMTP libraries to send a message. 
After that example, you can find more complete instructions that use the SendGrid Python library.

##### Using Python's SMTP Library 

This Python program will build a multi-part MIME email and send it through SendGrid. 
Python has built in libraries to send and receive emails. This example uses:

* [smtplib](http://docs.python.org/library/smtplib.html)
* [email](http://docs.python.org/library/email.html#module-email)
